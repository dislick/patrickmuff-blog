After deciding that Wordpress was not working out for me, I decided to remake my blog with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). This is the first post of hopefully many to come.

I have recently been to Lucerne and took lots of pictures of birds with the Sony A7R II. It was quite tricky to get the focus right, but in the end I managed to take this shot.
