Spent the last weekend in Paris, lovely city. The TGV (Train Ã  Grande Vitesse) brought us from Basel to Paris in just three hours. 10/10 would go again.

PS: It's going to be interesting to see how much smartphone cameras can improve in the next years. This photo of the Eiffel Tower was shot on an iPhone X.
