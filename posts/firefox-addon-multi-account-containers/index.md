As a response to my previous post [Why I switched from Chrome to Firefox](/blog/switch-to-firefox) my buddy [Yannick Fricke](https://twitter.com/YannickFricke) told me to check out the Firefox Add-on [Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/).

> Firefox Multi-Account Containers lets you keep parts of your online life separated into color-coded tabs that preserve your privacy. Cookies are separated by container, allowing you to use the web with multiple identities or accounts simultaneously.

After an initial setup phase where you create separate containers and assign websites to them, it just works and you never have to think about it again. While I am aware that it won't perfectly restrict tracking across containers, because browser fingerprinting is [almost impossible to avoid](http://jcarlosnorte.com/security/2016/03/06/advanced-tor-browser-fingerprinting.html) with JavaScript enabled, it sure makes it a lot harder.
